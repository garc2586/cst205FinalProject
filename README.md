## Authors

## Project Description
For our project we wanted to make a python application that allowed a user to download a YouTube video or audio of their choice. The user would have to get the YouTube url of the video or audio clip they want to download. They then paste the video url into the input box from the application GUI. Once the user presses the search button, our program will return a list of options for video and audio they user can download. The different options are dependent on resolution, file format and audio bitrate in the case of audio. Finally once the user has chosen the video or audio file they want to save, a new window opens that lets the user choose the location where they want to save their file and what they want to name it.
