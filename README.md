## Project Description
For our project we wanted to make a python application that allowed a user to download a YouTube video or audio of their choice. The user would have to get the YouTube url of the video or audio clip they want to download. They then paste the video url into the input box from the application GUI. Once the user presses the search button, our program will return a list of options for video and audio they user can download. The different options are dependent on resolution, file format and audio bitrate in the case of audio. Finally once the user has chosen the video or audio file they want to save, a new window opens that lets the user choose the location where they want to save their file and what they want to name it.

"#This project is to let the users download some videos from youtube. It is some because if the video that you ar etrying to download is copyrighted, you will not be able to download it."
"#First when you run the application, the GUI pops up, and you will paste the youtube url into the search bar"
"#Then when you search it, a drop-down menu will pop-up with the choices you have to download, either video or audio files."
"#After you choose the file, you may press save as and this will take you into a new window, where you choose where you are going to download it."
"#After you do this, you will be able to go to the place where you saved it, and you will find the file you just downloaded"
